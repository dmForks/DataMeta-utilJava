# Joda Time Extensions for DataMeta

We are in process of phasing Joda Time out and replacing it with the JDK 8's [`java.time`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) 
instead.

Once done with that, we'd preserve this project for historical reasons and/or for cases when using Joda Time is warranted.
